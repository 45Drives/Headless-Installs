#################### Ceph Preconfig ####################
This is an alternate version of the Ceph Preconfig ks.cfg file intended for physical hardware installations that have network access.

This Kickstart file automates the installation of Rocky 9 and contains the following functionality:
-Creates mirrored boot drives (hardcoded to use /dev/sda and /dev/sdb; to be changed if boot drives are different).
-Creates .repo files for 45Drives and Ceph (hardcoded for latest Squid release; change if needed) during post-installation.
-Performs core steps of the Rocky9 Ceph Preconfig script (installs 45Drives tools plus Cockpit and associated modules).
-Installs Cephadm from included Ceph repo and Podman for quick cluster addition/deployment after installation.
-Sets hostname as "cephnode"; change in script if necessary or manually change post-install.
-Sets network settings to DHCP for convenience; change manually after installation.
-Does not create a user on the host; use root to login and create additional users manually when needed.
-root user password hash set to "password". Change in script or manually post-installation if needed.
